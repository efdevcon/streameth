{"id":"188","name":"Biology study group - meeting #1","description":"The first meeting for our intro to bio study group (aka biology for non-biologists aka life sci 101 etc etc)\n\nCome hang for an hour or two and discuss what you'd like to learn during your time here! Next monday/tuesday we'll also be doing some experiments of our own using Odin CRISPR kits to engineer our own glow in the dark bacteria! So plan to attend a prep session on monday (time TBD)\n\nI'm booking the board room for 6-8pm. I'd like to aim to meet at 6 or 7, but we can discuss in the #biology-study-group channel on discord.","stage":{"id":"Board Room","name":"Board Room"},"start":1680278400000,"end":1680285600000,"speakers":[{"id":"Boris Dyakov","name":"Boris Dyakov"}]}
