How do you tell good science from bad? This session covers common ways science is misinterpreted, misaligned, and what to watch out for as you navigate the longevity science landscape.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<p>- Failed aging theories</p>\n<p>- Reproducibility crisis</p>\n<p>- Artisanal science</p>\n<p>- Bad incentives</p>\n<p>- Low impact work vs high impact work</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>About the course</strong></p>\n<p>Longevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t have a biology background, we highly recommend attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology).
