  "gpt_description": "This video is the second workshop about the Zuzulu passport, which allows users to log in to Zuzulu.city and prove they are a member without revealing their identity. The workshop demonstrates a new feature that allows users to prove they own a particular Ethereum address. The video shows a demo of how to use this feature and how third-party integration websites can request proof of ownership. The video also includes a discussion of the code and how the passport verifies the proof."
