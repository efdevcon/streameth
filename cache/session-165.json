Powdr provides an assembly and a polynomial identity languages, where constant polynomials are defined in the language itself. Witnesses are generated deterministically and automatically during the compilation process. As a PoC, we have implemented a subset of RISCV in Powdr, where you can make ZKPs about no-std Rust programs directly.<br>\n<br>\n</p>","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome"},"start":1682089200000,"end":1682091000000,"speakers":[{"id":"Leo Alt |Ethereum Foundation","name":"Leo Alt |Ethereum Foundation"}]}
