  "gpt_description": "In this video, Lily talks about the project Plex, which is being developed by LabDow to create an operating system for network science organizations. She explains LabDow's philosophy of enabling everyone to access laboratory services and how they are creating an open exchange for life science services. Lily discusses the challenges of open science and how blockchain tech and web 3 are being used to give people the ability to collaborate across borders and institutions. She then dives into the details of Plex, explaining how it builds simple workflows for scientists and allows users to run scientific application containers from anywhere in the world. She also talks about the decentralized file storage and peer-to-peer data used in Plex and how it enables better regulatory compliance and safer computations. Finally, Lily demonstrates how easily scientists can use Plex to generate data using the example of small molecule binding."
