  "gpt_description": "In this video, Jonas discusses the retroactive public goods funding that the optimism collective recently completed. He provides a framework for how this funding works, including impact scoping, investment in impact, and impact scoring. He also discusses the trade-offs between funding specific outcomes versus specific outputs and the risk involved in each approach. The discussion also touches on how slow-burn projects are evaluated and how the voters aggregate their preferences. The goal of the video is to have a discussion and encourage viewers to chime in with their opinions."
