  "description": "<p>Michael Smith is the Inventor of the Earth Power Lodge which was showcased in a documentary that won over ten awards and has more than 25,000,000 views.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>His invention turns biomass waste into power, organic food, fertilizer and soil amendments while purifying water and sequestering CO2. His system uses AI ML. He's keen on open source decentralization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You don't want to miss this talk. It's a game changer.</p>\n<p>To top it off you can build one of these things starting at around 2million and do 4million in revenue the first year - while doing amazing things for the planet.</p>\n<p>We are incredibly fortunate that he's making time to present to us. Please join in. He will zoom into the Dome.</p>",

  "gpt_description": "In this video, the speaker discusses his work with Algae Aquaculture Technologies and how he began to componentize the system to use as a template for a variety of waste streams and inputs. He compares the components to software objects and sees a similarity to artificial intelligence in their behavior. The speaker also discusses the use of biomass as a solar collector and the regeneration of soil through regenerative agriculture. He emphasizes the importance of building sustainable systems that revitalize communities and discusses the idea of a neural network connecting earth power large nodes for marketing and distribution. Finally, the speaker discusses the behavior of different components and the potential for using waste heat in the system."
