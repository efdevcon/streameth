{"id":"166","name":"Intro to Nova","description":"<p>This workshop will introduce Nova, a simple yet powerful recursive SNARK proof system. We'll start by highlighting the amazing properties Nova enjoys for incrementally verifiable computation (IVC). We'll then introduce the main Nova building block called a \"folding scheme\", explain the details of how Nova works for R1CS, and tease some of the generalisations of Nova including SuperNova and HyperNova.</p>","track":"ZK Week","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome","stream":[{"id":"dd91a031-33e3-4567-aa35-d8df14a030f4"}]},"start":1681835400000,"end":1681840800000,"speakers":[{"id":"Justin Drake","name":"Justin Drake"}]}
