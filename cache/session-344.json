  "description": "<p><strong>Session 1: General Biology</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Assuming zero background in biology, we quickly go over important concepts you will need to understand how and why we age, and how the interventions discussed in later sessions work. Topics:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Central dogma</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Biomolecules</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Biochemistry</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Metabolism</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Homeostasis</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cells, tissues, organs</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Immune system</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- What we still don’t know about biology</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>About the course</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Longevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If you don’t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!</p>",
