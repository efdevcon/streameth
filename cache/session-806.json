  "description": "<p>Play as a network state in a onchain world with dynamic lore.<br>\n<br>\n\"Network States\" is an on-chain game that combines GPT-4 text generation with MUD, an onchain game engine. Set in a world of network states and various political factions, the game is inspired by programming and discussions at Zuzalu.</p>\n<p>As a player, you'll take on the role of a new network state, striving to expand your population and influence. \"Network States\" is a real-time strategy (RTS) game that fuels an evolving narrative as players develop their states and interact with others. Drawing inspiration from early collective worldbuilding games, such as Slobbovia (1972-1986).</p>\n<p>Developed during our time at Zuzalu, \"Network States\" explores the potential for onchain games as engines for generative worldbuilding.
