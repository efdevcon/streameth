{"id":"360","name":"Muse Dance Party","description":"<p>If the Oxford Muse Dinner had a baby with a dance party, this would be it! We will combine the joy of movement and the power of vulnerability to foster deep connections and authentic human interactions.</p>\n<p>We will start with a dynamic and energizing dance session, where you'll be invited to move freely and let your body express itself without any judgment or inhibition.</p>\n<p>We will gradually introduce the element of vulnerability by pairing participants off and inviting them to answer questions. These questions are designed to create a safe and supportive environment where you can share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with others who are open and receptive to listening.</p>\n<p>You'll leave the event feeling inspired, uplifted, and connected to a community of like-minded people who share your desire for authentic human connections.</p>\n<p>This is a welcoming and inclusive space for anyone who wants to explore the power of vulnerability and connection through dance. Come join us and let your heart beat to the rhythm of life!</p>","track":"Other","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome"},"start":1683741600000,"end":1683747000000,"speakers":[{"id":"ilana brown","name":"ilana brown"}]}
