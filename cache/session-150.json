  "description": "<p>Running ai/ml models in a zero-knowledge proof makes it as though they run on chain. This lets the chain perceive the world and gives smart contracts the ability to exercise judgement. Learn how to take your own ML models and turn them into provers and on-chain verifiers using our open-source tool ezkl (<a href=\"https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl\" title=\"https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl\"><u>https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl</u></a>). Beginner-friendly, but we will also delve into some technical and mathematical details for the interested. <br>\n<br>\nTarget audience: People who are new to ZK but who have a technical background, or are experienced with ZK and are curious about the technical details of how ezkl works.<br>\nBeginner-friendly, but we will also delve into some technical and mathematical details for the interested.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>People who are new to ZK but who have a technical background, or are experienced with ZK and are curious about the technical details of how ezkl works.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br>\n&nbsp;</p>",
