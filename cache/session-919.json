{"id":"919","name":"John Cage (silent) party","description":"<p>We invite you to a John Cage party. Wednesday, 7 pm, D111 apartment&nbsp;</p>\n<p>John Cage was an American composer. One of his most famous pieces is 4′33″ (“four minutes, thirty-three seconds” or just “four thirty-three”).</p>\n<p>It was composed in 1952 for any instrument or combination of instruments, and the score instructs performers not to play their instruments during the entire duration of the piece throughout the three movements. So, that is four minutes, thirty-three seconds of silence.</p>\n<p>John Cage claimed that 4‘33‘‘ was his most important work. That is… His most important work, in his own words, was nothing.</p>\n<p>John Cage party (or silent parity) is a party where words are not allowed. Literally: no single word for no single person. If you come, you take an agreement to stay silent until you leave the party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consider it as a social experiment, unfacilitated meditation, or a trusted block box.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will cook a couple of dessert options (one vegan and one regular). Feel free to bring a drink or snack for yourself if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have any questions feel free to ask @l_girll on tg.&nbsp;</p>","track":"Open Sessions","stage":{"id":"0","name":"Unknown","stream":[{"id":""}]},"start":1684342800000,"end":1684346400000,"speakers":[{"id":"Lisa Akselrod","name":"Lisa Akselrod"},{"id":"Laura Helen ","name":"Laura Helen "},{"id":"Gary Sheng","name":"Gary Sheng"}]}
