  "description": "<p><strong>Session 10: Aging Interventions: Replace</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Final session on longevity interventions.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>This session covers interventions around “replacement” — replacing body parts or the whole body with a new, younger body. Topics:</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>- Tissue / organ replacement</p>\n<p>- Full body replacement</p>\n<p>- Brain tissue replacement</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>About the course</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Longevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!</p>",
