{"id":"646","name":"Let Your Ideas Go ðŸš€ (Share Your Side Project)","description":"<p>Let your ideas go ðŸš€</p>\n<p>As creative folks, developers and entrepreneurs, we all have lots of great ideas. However, we only have 24 hours ðŸ•™ in a day, which means that we won't have the time to ever implement all of our ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Therefore, we will host a session for \"letting your ideas go ðŸš€\". Share your ideas and inspire others who may have the time and desire to pick them up and make them a reality.</p>\n<p>No pitch decks or presentations are needed. We will conduct an open conversation, ask some questions and try to refine ideas together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have any ideas you'd like to share (for products, projects, services, non profit or anything at all) or if you want to hear and take inspiration from other people's ideas.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;join us at B111, just come and ring the e-bell at the entrace. We will prepare tap water and glasses (sorry the grocery shop is closed)</p>","track":"Open Sessions","stage":{"id":"0","name":"Unknown","stream":[{"id":""}]},"start":1683048600000,"end":1683052200000,"speakers":[{"id":"Chichi Hong","name":"Chichi Hong"}]}
