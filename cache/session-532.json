  "description": "<p>Capoeira is a martial art/game/dance/cultural tradition that was born in Brazil amidst the encounter of many African cultures in the forced diaspora. The way I see it, it's a body/energy/spiritual practice suitable for anyone. It's also very playful.<br>\n<br>\nIn this session I hope to share basic movements and context for this practice - as well as some of its music. Participants will be able to do exercise and play in a Capoeira \"roda\" (Capoeira circle).<br>\n<br>\nHere's a video with two great living master of this art (from the \"Angola tradition\") playing together:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzHk9tOp9V8</p>",
