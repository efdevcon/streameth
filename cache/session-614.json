We on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t have a biology background, we highly recommend attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!</p>","track":"Longevity 0-1","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome"},"start":1683460800000,"end":1683464400000,"speakers":[{"id":"Cat Thu","name":"Cat Thu"},{"id":"Ryan Spangler","name":"Ryan Spangler"},{"id":"Ksenia Winslow","name":"Ksenia Winslow"}]}
