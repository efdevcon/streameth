{"id":"474","name":"Network State book in 1h: Collaborative reading session ","description":"<p><strong>Haven't read the Network State Book and wanna get it in 2h or less?</strong></p>\n<p>We're doing a collaborative reading excercise to get the basics of the book in 1h, and use it as the starting point to discuss how to apply these insights for Zuzalu.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everyone reads a chapter and next week we meet up for everyone to pitch their chapter and their insights in 5min.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>As a supporting tool we had the idea of using Memex to collaboratively annotate the chapters of the book. (<a href=\"https://memex.garden\">https://memex.garden</a>)</p>\n<p>Since today, also the web annotator is live, so no need to install any extra software.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I made a short video that explains how to use it <a href=\"https://share.descript.com/view/fVDrUm7WGBX\">https://share.descript.com/view/fVDrUm7WGBX</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.

Accept the invite to the Memex Space</p>\n<p>3. Pick a chapter of the book you want to read</p>\n<p>4. Optionally but useful: Annotate it with the Memex web reader or the extension&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.
