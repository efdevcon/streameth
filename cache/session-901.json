Based on cutting-edge technology, three decades of research and over 200,000 samples, this biomarker integrates genetic, epigenetic and environmental aspects of ageing, responds to lifestyle interventions and is proven to be the best predictor of future health outcomes (detecting risk from disease 10 years in advance!).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The secret behind it are glycans - complex sugar molecules which exist on every cell surface and are highly responsive to lifestyle changes. In fact, glycans detect and measure chronic inflammation, the most significant cause of death globally.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Join us on Saturday to learn more about the most revolutionary tool for prevention and get your glycans tested. You can then expect your GlycanAge results in 4-6 weeks. Not only that, but you will also have a 1:1 discussion with one of GlycanAge care specialist where you will look at your results in more detail, find out what are the current sources of inflammation in your body and what specific changes/ interventions will help you slow down aging.</p>","track":"Longevity 0-1","stage":{"id":"Board Room","name":"Board Room","stream":[{"id":"fe9970f6-1dee-40e1-8e9f-5bc99fed7dec"}]},"start":1684062000000,"end":1684065600000,"speakers":[{"id":"Marko Tarnaj","name":"Marko Tarnaj"},{"id":"Julija Jurić","name":"Julija Jurić"}]}
