We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!</p>","track":"Longevity 0-1","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome"},"start":1683720000000,"end":1683723600000,"speakers":[{"id":"Cat Thu","name":"Cat Thu"},{"id":"Ksenia Winslow","name":"Ksenia Winslow"}]}
