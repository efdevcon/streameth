{"id":"152","name":"Intro: Folding Scheme Math Building Blocks","description":"<p>Novaâ€™s [KST21] folding scheme is a lightweight protocol for recursive proof composition. This session lays the mathematical groundwork for understanding the components of a folding scheme, and introduces the contexts in which it is useful. We will cover primitives such as vector commitment schemes, random linear combinations, the Fiat-Shamir transform, as well as incrementally verifiable computation and zk-SNARKs on a high level.&nbsp;</p>","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome"},"start":1681743600000,"end":1681749000000,"speakers":[{"id":"Ying Tong","name":"Ying Tong"}]}
