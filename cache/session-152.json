This session lays the mathematical groundwork for understanding the components of a folding scheme, and introduces the contexts in which it is useful. We will cover primitives such as vector commitment schemes, random linear combinations, the Fiat-Shamir transform, as well as incrementally verifiable computation and zk-SNARKs on a high level.&nbsp;</p>",
