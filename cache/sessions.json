Today we’re always a click away from being de-platformed by centralized social networks. Web3 social could become a “credible neutral” basis for our communication and online collaboration. But the decentralized nature of these networks also raises important questions about data privacy, ownership and governance that we must address.\n\nSever and Martin are working at the AKASHA Foundation. Since releasing our first experiment, the on-chain AKASHA app in 2017 the space has evolved quite a bit. We see different protocols popping up such as Farcaster, ATProtocol (bluesky), Nostr….\n\nWe would like to invite you to a brainstorming workshop discussing all about Web3 social this Thursday, March 30 from 5 to 6pm.\n\nHere’a s list of topics we could cover - but feel free to also bring your own: \n\n- What does Web3/ decentralized social really mean?\n- What is minimal viable decentralization?\n- Comparing existing protocols for new social apps (federated vs decentralized) …and why/ do we need so many?\n- What governance (DAOs) and moderating for new online communities do we need?\n- What might a Zuzalu native social app look like?\n- ...\n\nWhere? \nWe are in apartment C904.

It's about bringing your attention to your physical sensations, emotions, and movements, and using them to deepen your understanding of yourself and your interactions with others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In these workshops, you will have the opportunity to learn about embodiment through a variety of exercises and activities over a period of 4 days, held at Zuzalu. We will guide you through practices such as breathwork, movement, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which are designed to help you tune in to your body and cultivate awareness.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We hope that if you join, you commit to the entire experience - from opening ceremony to closing ceremony. Growth happens best in community, ritual, vulnerability, depth and practice and there will be people who are trained to hold you in your deepest moments. Moving your body can bring up emotions that have been suppressed, and finally give them expression. Express and release. We all have pent up emotions. You are not alone. These emotions deserve to be expressed, they deserve to have a voice and a movement, and ohhhh does it feel good. &nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>No prior experience is required, and we welcome individuals of all levels of fitness and ability.

It's about bringing your attention to your physical sensations, emotions, and movements, and using them to deepen your understanding of yourself and your interactions with others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In these workshops, you will have the opportunity to learn about embodiment through a variety of exercises and activities over a period of 4 days, held at Zuzalu. We will guide you through practices such as breathwork, movement, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which are designed to help you tune in to your body and cultivate awareness.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We hope that if you join, you commit to the entire experience - from opening ceremony to closing ceremony. Growth happens best in community, ritual, vulnerability, depth and practice and there will be people who are trained to hold you in your deepest moments. Moving your body can bring up emotions that have been suppressed, and finally give them expression. Express and release. We all have pent up emotions. You are not alone. These emotions deserve to be expressed, they deserve to have a voice and a movement, and ohhhh does it feel good. &nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>No prior experience is required, and we welcome individuals of all levels of fitness and ability. Our facilitators will be on hand to offer guidance and support throughout the workshop.</p>\n<p>Come join us and explore the fascinating world of embodiment!<br>\n</p>","event_slug":"open-sessions-series","event_item_id":130,"event_type":"Workshop","format":"Live","track":"Other","level":"Beginner","location":"Other","quota_id":null,"creator_uuid":null,"duration":"90","creator_id":9,"custom_location":"Dome","end_time":"12:30","capacity":null,"favoritedSessions":[],"participants":[]},{"id":467,"created_at":"2023-04-20T15:19:18.808839+00:00","name":"Farmers Market","startDate":"2023-04-24","startTime":"12:00:00","tags":[],"info":"","event_id":101,"hasTicket":false,"team_members":[{"name":"Janine Leger","role":"Organizer"},{"name":"Marijana Lemme","role":"Organizer"},{"name":"Marko","role":"Organizer"}],"equipment":"","subevent_id":null,"description":"<p>Local farmers from the area come and share their produce with us:) Please bring cash to buy anything.&nbsp;</p>","event_slug":"open-sessions-series","event_item_id":130,"event_type":"Workshop","format":"Live","track":"Other","level":"Beginner","location":"Other","quota_id":null,"creator_uuid":null,"duration":"180","creator_id":28,"custom_location":"Dome","end_time":null,"capacity":null,"favoritedSessions":[],"participants":[]},{"id":438,"created_at":"2023-04-18T21:23:52.956123+00:00","name":"Network State Book Primer (2HRS)","startDate":"2023-04-25","startTime":"17:00","tags":["NetworkState"],"info":"","event_id":93,"hasTicket":false,"team_members":[{"name":"Lori Corpuz","role":"Organizer"},{"name":"Oliver Sauter","role":"Organizer"},{"name":"Ori Shimony","role":"Organizer"}],"equipment":"","subevent_id":null,"description":"<p>A primer for the Zuzalu community in advance of the Network State sessions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goal of our time together is to provide a foundational introduction to the community so we can move into the weekend Network State sessions primed and ready to expand our impact as a community.<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Agenda:</strong><br>\nSummary of each chapter by leads, and discussion of application to Zuzalu</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Chapter 1 (TBD)</li>\n  <li>Chapter 2 (TBD)</li>\n  <li>Chapter 3 (Lori)</li>\n  <li>Chapter 4 (TBD)</li>\n  <li>Chapter 5 (TBD)</li>\n  <li>Zuzalu Application</li>\n</ol>","event_slug":"new-cities-series","event_item_id":112,"event_type":"Workshop","format":"Live","track":"New Cities & Network States","level":"Beginner","location":"Board Room","quota_id":null,"creator_uuid":null,"duration":"120","creator_id":51,"custom_location":"","end_time":"19:00","capacity":null,"favoritedSessions":[],"participants":[]},{"id":360,"created_at":"2023-04-15T20:29:18.418702+00:00","name":"Muse Dance Party","startDate":"2023-04-26","startTime":"20:00","tags":["dance","connection"],"info":"chairs cleared","event_id":101,"hasTicket":false,"team_members":[{"name":"ilana brown","role":"Facilitator"}],"equipment":"music microphone","subevent_id":null,"description":"<p>If the Oxford Muse Dinner had a baby with a dance party, this would be it!
