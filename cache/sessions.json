Today we’re always a click away from being de-platformed by centralized social networks. Web3 social could become a “credible neutral” basis for our communication and online collaboration. But the decentralized nature of these networks also raises important questions about data privacy, ownership and governance that we must address.\n\nSever and Martin are working at the AKASHA Foundation. Since releasing our first experiment, the on-chain AKASHA app in 2017 the space has evolved quite a bit. We see different protocols popping up such as Farcaster, ATProtocol (bluesky), Nostr….\n\nWe would like to invite you to a brainstorming workshop discussing all about Web3 social this Thursday, March 30 from 5 to 6pm.\n\nHere’a s list of topics we could cover - but feel free to also bring your own: \n\n- What does Web3/ decentralized social really mean?\n- What is minimal viable decentralization?\n- Comparing existing protocols for new social apps (federated vs decentralized) …and why/ do we need so many?\n- What governance (DAOs) and moderating for new online communities do we need?\n- What might a Zuzalu native social app look like?\n- ...\n\nWhere? \nWe are in apartment C904. The best way to get there is through our terrace next to the outdoor pool.

It's about bringing your attention to your physical sensations, emotions, and movements, and using them to deepen your understanding of yourself and your interactions with others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In these workshops, you will have the opportunity to learn about embodiment through a variety of exercises and activities over a period of 4 days, held at Zuzalu. We will guide you through practices such as breathwork, movement, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which are designed to help you tune in to your body and cultivate awareness.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We hope that if you join, you commit to the entire experience - from opening ceremony to closing ceremony. Growth happens best in community, ritual, vulnerability, depth and practice and there will be people who are trained to hold you in your deepest moments. Moving your body can bring up emotions that have been suppressed, and finally give them expression. Express and release. We all have pent up emotions. You are not alone. These emotions deserve to be expressed, they deserve to have a voice and a movement, and ohhhh does it feel good. &nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>No prior experience is required, and we welcome individuals of all levels of fitness and ability.

Additionally, we will share some insights, benchmarks, and challenges observed in concrete experiments with a parallelised Nova implementation as part of a recent Nova zkVM effort.</p>","event_slug":"ZK","event_item_id":113,"event_type":"Discussion","format":"Live","track":"ZK Week","level":"Intermediate","location":"Ballroom","quota_id":null,"creator_uuid":null,"duration":"120","creator_id":12,"custom_location":"","end_time":"20:30","capacity":null,"favoritedSessions":[],"participants":[],"totalParticipants":2},{"id":359,"created_at":"2023-04-15T20:27:51.315969+00:00","name":"Embodiment Weekend - Sharing Circle + Expression Movement into music jam session / open mic","startDate":"2023-04-21","startTime":"19:00","tags":["embodiment"],"info":"chairs cleared","event_id":101,"hasTicket":false,"team_members":[{"name":"ilana brown","role":"Organizer"},{"name":"","role":"Speaker"},{"name":"","role":"Speaker"}],"equipment":"music, microphone","subevent_id":null,"description":"<p>Sharing Circle for embodiment week, with embodied movement&nbsp;</p>","event_slug":"open-sessions-series","event_item_id":130,"event_type":"Workshop","format":"Live","track":"Other","level":"Beginner","location":"Other","quota_id":null,"creator_uuid":null,"duration":"180","creator_id":9,"custom_location":"Dome","end_time":"19:30","capacity":null,"favoritedSessions":[],"participants":[],"totalParticipants":3},{"id":476,"created_at":"2023-04-21T09:39:13.237019+00:00","name":"FEEL GOOD DANCE PARTAY 🕺🏻🎉🚨","startDate":"2023-04-21","startTime":"20:30","tags":[],"info":"","event_id":101,"hasTicket":false,"team_members":[{"name":"DJ Madison","role":"Organizer"}],"equipment":"Sound system ","subevent_id":null,"description":"<p>You worked hard this week.

It's about bringing your attention to your physical sensations, emotions, and movements, and using them to deepen your understanding of yourself and your interactions with others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In these workshops, you will have the opportunity to learn about embodiment through a variety of exercises and activities over a period of 4 days, held at Zuzalu. We will guide you through practices such as breathwork, movement, meditation, and mindfulness, all of which are designed to help you tune in to your body and cultivate awareness.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We hope that if you join, you commit to the entire experience - from opening ceremony to closing ceremony. Growth happens best in community, ritual, vulnerability, depth and practice and there will be people who are trained to hold you in your deepest moments. Moving your body can bring up emotions that have been suppressed, and finally give them expression. Express and release. We all have pent up emotions. You are not alone. These emotions deserve to be expressed, they deserve to have a voice and a movement, and ohhhh does it feel good. &nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>No prior experience is required, and we welcome individuals of all levels of fitness and ability. Our facilitators will be on hand to offer guidance and support throughout the workshop.</p>\n<p>Come join us and explore the fascinating world of embodiment!<br>\n</p>","event_slug":"open-sessions-series","event_item_id":130,"event_type":"Community Gathering","format":"Live","track":"Other","level":"Beginner","location":"Other","quota_id":null,"creator_uuid":null,"duration":"90","creator_id":9,"custom_location":"Dome","end_time":"11:00","capacity":100,"favoritedSessions":[],"participants":[],"totalParticipants":3},{"id":520,"created_at":"2023-04-23T10:26:34.680184+00:00","name":"Intro to Flow Arts","startDate":"2023-04-24","startTime":"12:00","tags":["Movement","Circus"],"info":"","event_id":101,"hasTicket":false,"team_members":[{"name":"Noah Chon Lee","role":"resident"}],"equipment":"None","subevent_id":null,"description":"<p>Grab some sock poi and learn the basics of object manipulation and movement through flow arts!

The viral component of this holobiont is referred to as the “human virome.” This virome contains bacteriophage and DNA/RNA viruses. Bacteriophage are viruses that infect bacteria and modulate their activity, and trillions of bacteriophage traffic human tissue and blood at any given moment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>However, despite the fact that human and virus biology is intricately connected, certain DNA and RNA virome members such as herpesviruses can contribute to diseases of aging and inflammaging. These viruses have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to directly hijack the activity of the human genome, the human immune response, and human metabolism. For example, the amyloid beta “plaque” that accumulates in the Alzheimer’s brain is now being studied as a peptide that forms in response to viral pathogens in brain tissue[1].</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Persistent viruses can also disrupt human signaling directly connected to aging processes. For example, one network analysis uncovered dozens of viruses encoding proteins experimentally demonstrated to interact with proteins from pathways associated with human aging, including cellular senescence[2]. Viral infection can also have profound effects on host cell processes relevant to telomere biology and genome maintenance[3], with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) capable of driving telomere dysfunction by directly integrating into host telomeric DNA.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Human virome-driven contributions to aging processes may be rapidly accelerating due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus driving the COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly being studied as a virus capable of long-term persistence in a wide range of human body and brain sites[4]. We may consequently be seeding the human population with yet one more virus that can drive human genome, metabolic and senescence-related dysfunction under certain conditions.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It follows that the rapid development of novel antiviral drugs, immunotherapies, and prophylactics could help control virome activity in a manner that should promote human longevity. However, development and use of these novel therapeutics must be done with great transparency. The general public must be fully engaged in the process, so that potential side effects and the “risk-reward” ratios for certain therapeutics can be thoughtfully evaluated and debated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>1.
