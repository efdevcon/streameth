The Guild aims to incentivize talented individuals from all over the world to contribute to Ethereum's vision of being a global network that empowers individuals. The Guild is a list of 128 active core protocol contributors, and donations to this work can be made to a single Ethereum address, with funds distributed based on a retroactive time weighting and a forward-looking vesting module. The Guild aims to reduce contributor churn and facilitate knowledge transfer by creating long-term incentives for contributors to continue contributing."}
