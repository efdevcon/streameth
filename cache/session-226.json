  "gpt_description": "The speaker discusses the limitations of current treatments for spinal cord injuries and the potential for synthetic biology to revolutionize cell therapies. They explain how current methods for creating han cells are inconsistent and time-consuming due to stochastic events, and how synthetic biology can be used to engineer stem cells to create specific cell types more efficiently. The speaker also showcases their company's ability to create pure, functional neurons in a matter of days using this technology."
