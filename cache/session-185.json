  "description": "<p>In this workshop, we present Poseidon, the missing infra for building zkDApps on Ethereum. Poseidon provides three things: 1)&nbsp;composable ZKP primitives&nbsp;as smart contract so that DApp developers donâ€™t have to write ZKP circuits on their own. 2)&nbsp;DApp SDK&nbsp;that helps the DApp developers build ZKP proof generation on client side (e.g. browser). 3)&nbsp;ZK-ZK Aggregator&nbsp;that aggregates a batch of client generated proofs into a single proof so that the amortized ZKP verification cost (gas cost) can be greatly reduced.<br>\n<br>\nThe workshop will include talks about the architecture, demos of building zkDApps, and panel discussion about co-processor architecture.<br>\n<br>\nAudience: People who are interested in ZK technology, Ethereum Developers that don't know too much about ZK but want to build zkDApps.</p>",
