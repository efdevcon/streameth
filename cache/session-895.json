  "description": "<p>Hi I'm Greg ðŸ‘‹ I want to organize a breathwork session in the sauna tonight, around 7:45pm. We'll be leveraging Othership's app guide us along the way. If you've never done breathwork, or you have but not in a sauna setting, its a truly amazing experience.</p>\n<p>The session itself will be a bit short, it can be a bit extreme in there if you stay for too long. We'll try a beginner/intermediate class that will be 10-15 minutes long :)</p>\n<p>If you don't know Othership, it's a really amazing sauna &amp; icebath experience from Toronto (they're expanding). Read more about them here: https://www.othership.us/ (im not affiliated, just a big advocate of breathwork/sauna/icebaths).</p>\n<p>&lt;3&nbsp;</p>",
