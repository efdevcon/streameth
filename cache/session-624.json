  "description": "<p><strong>Session 7: Models and Biomarkers</strong></p>\n<p>How do we tell if longevity interventions are extending our lifespans? By definition, to observe lifespan extension we will need to wait a lifetime. This session discusses approaches we use to shorten experiment time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Topics:</p>\n<p>- Animal models</p>\n<p>- Organoids / ex-vivo models</p>\n<p>- Biomarkers</p>\n<p>- Clocks</p>\n<p>- Omits / network</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>About the course:</strong></p>\n<p>Longevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t have a biology background, we highly recommend attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!</p>",
