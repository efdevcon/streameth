The movie features the legendary Franco Nero as Paolo, a man dying of terminal cancer. His grandson Max (played by Jeff DuJardin), the founder of an anti-aging company, is determined to save his beloved 'Papa' using cryonics â€“ the technique of deep-freezing the bodies of people who have just died in the hope that they can be revived in the future. However, Max's mother (played by Sherilyn Fenn), a single, alcoholic, and wandering Catholic, believes that Max's plan is immoral and barbaric and insists on a traditional funeral. This sets the stage for a battle over Paolo's immortality</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Cast&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The legend of the anti-aging movement&nbsp;&nbsp;Aubrey de Grey played himself there, as well as world-famous actors such as Sherilyn Fenn (Twin Peaks of David Lynch,&nbsp;&nbsp;nominee for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award), Franco Nero (Django), comedian/actor Paul Rodriguez and Aries Spears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Wins and nominations &nbsp;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11388604/awards/?ref_=tt_awd</p>\n<p>The teaser&nbsp;https://vimeo.com/523042372&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Producer &nbsp;Vladislav Alex Kozlov &nbsp;vladkozlov76@yahoo.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Zuzalu contact - Max (Telegram -TimeInc)</p>","track":"Longevity Biotech Conference","stage":{"id":"Dome","name":"Dome","stream":[{"id":"dd91a031-33e3-4567-aa35-d8df14a030f4"}]},"start":1684000800000,"end":1684004400000,"speakers":[{"id":"Maxim Kholin","name":"Maxim Kholin"},{"id":"Max Unfried","name":"Max Unfried"}]}
