  "description": "<p>The Zuzalu Muse dinners are an evening of connection and conversation. You will be paired with a fellow Zuzalian, who you have not previously met. Then, you will follow a conversation menu which will guide you through interesting topics, deep reflections, and fun explorations of each other's lives, past, present and future.<br>\n<br>\nOn the day of the dinner, you will be sent a secret code word. When you arrive, you must find your match by sharing your code word with them.<br>\n<br>\nDinner can be at Kiki's, or at any other restaurant. You will have to pay for your own dinner - we can't afford to get this one for you.<br>\n<br>\nTo attend, please RSVP at <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrbXk7IPjygyYsbd\">https://airtable.com/shrbXk7IPjygyYsbd</a> <br>\n</p>",
