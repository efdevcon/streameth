{"id":"168","name":"Advanced Folding Schemes","description":"<p>This workshop will provide an in-depth exploration of advanced folding scheme constructions, the building blocks that enable Nova's efficient and simple recursion scheme. We will begin by delving into Sangria, a folding scheme for PLONK. Next, we will discuss Nova's extension to support higher degree gates and lookups. And finally, we will explore speculative alternative ideas for adding in-circuit randomness and how Nova's PLONK-ish framing may point to a reframing of IVC itself.</p>","track":"ZK Week","stage":{"id":"5","name":"Dome"},"start":1682008200000,"end":1682011800000,"speakers":[{"id":"Aardvark","name":"Aardvark"},{"id":"Yan Zhang","name":"Yan Zhang"},{"id":"Lev Soukhanov","name":"Lev Soukhanov"}]}
