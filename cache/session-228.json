  "gpt_description": "The video features Kristen Albright, CEO of Procari, a synthetic biology company in London, discussing how bacteria can be used to produce better proteins and how regulation by the FDA is important in the bio-manufacturing industry. Albright also talks about the history of the FDA and its role in regulating food and drugs. She suggests that pre-competitive labs and collaborations can help move the industry forward and commercialize the output. Albright also mentions some companies, including Ginkgo and Wild, that are working in the field of synthetic biology."
