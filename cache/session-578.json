{"id":"578","name":"The Class with Natalie Kuhn","description":"<h1><strong>What is The Class?</strong> The Class is a fun and challenging workout that combines strength-training, cardio, and mindfulness to help you feel better.</h1>\n<p>The practice is mat-based and music-driven. We repeat one move per song to create sensation in the body and observe our thoughts. In any given Class students can expect guided instruction and a carefully curated playlist to lead them through exercises they are familiar with such asâ€”squats, jumping jacks, and burpees.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe result is a mental clearing and emotional release. Through continued practice, students develop tools to empower their life, along with an incredibly strong, resilient, body.</p>","track":"Open Sessions","stage":{"id":"0","name":"Unknown","stream":[{"id":""}]},"start":1683268200000,"end":1683271800000,"speakers":[{"id":"Natalie Kuhn","name":"Natalie Kuhn"}]}
