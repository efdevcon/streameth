  "description": "<p><strong>Session 9: Bioengineering / bioinformatics</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>This session has two parts. Part 1 covers common topics and challenges in engineering biological systems. Part 2 is an overview of bioinformatics work. Topics:</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>- Bioengineering overview</p>\n<p>- Gene editing</p>\n<p>- Gene delivery</p>\n<p>- Bioinformatics&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>About the course</strong></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Longevity Zero to One is a course designed to get you from zero biology to a general understanding of the intervention landscape and bottlenecks to progress. We emphasize on helping participants apply their existing skillsets to high-impact areas in longevity.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Attending all sessions is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t have a biology background, we strongly advise attending the 1st session (General Biology) and 2nd session (Aging Biology). If you do have a background in biology, feel free to skip the 1st session!</p>",
