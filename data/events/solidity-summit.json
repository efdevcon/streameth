The main body of the talk, however, will focus on a simple question: \"what can I do as a developer to make my smart contract auditor more efficient and effective?\" This is not much different from asking \"how can I write better code?\" but I intend to give actionable advice, based on numerous audits (and instances of hair pulling).",

All this code was generated by looking at the AST, abi and contract code in the code-gen process.

                "abstract": "While Yul is a low-level language that provides only a thin abstraction over the bare opcodes of the EVM, the transition from Yul to EVM bytecode still leaves room for certain choices: most obviously the control-flow structures of Yul have to be translated to plain jumps in the EVM. But furthermore, Yul does not presuppose the layout of its variables on the EVM's stack - and due to the fact that the EVM merely allows access to the 16 top-most values on its stack, the precise construction of suitable stack layouts and transitions between them is particularly important.\nIn this talk, I will sketch the inner workings of the Yul-to-EVM code transform used in the new via-IR compilation pipeline with enabled optimizer. I will discuss its advantages over the more naive approach used for Yul components in the legacy compiler pipeline, how it interacts with the Yul optimizer to move variables from stack to memory to avoid stack-too-deep errors and what further improvements can be expected in the near future. Lastly, I will hint at the challenges this new mechanism presents for tooling and debuggers.",
