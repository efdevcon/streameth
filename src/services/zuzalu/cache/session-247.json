Intended as a \"round 1\". Topics may include:\n\n* What long-term things do people want? A permanent crypto+bio+philosophy town in Montenegro? A roaming nomad village? Once a year, or year round? Multiple forks?\n* The economics of organizing, including costs and how to achieve economic sustainability, saving money by mass booking off-peak, etc\n* The logistics and other practical complexities of organizing\n* The tradeoffs of independent resorts vs \"embedded inside a town\"\n* Which countries to go to\n* Social tradeoffs: how to balance being inclusive and not becoming an elite enclave, vs keeping the number of sketchy people, aggressive and power-seeking people, etc down. Should there be resident vs visitor distinctions, what should those look like? etc\n* Governance","track":"ZK Week","stage":"Dome","start":1680883200000,"end":1680888600000,"speakers":[{"id":"Vitalik Buterin","name":"Vitalik Buterin"}]}
